# birthday
A simple app wishing "happy birthday"

- Firstly i created the 3 boxes in html structure page. 
I created the divs and write some text in it and also created the button "Click me". 
- Then i decorate the boxes and the page with css. 
I set the background of the page and the background of boxes; the font size, the width, the height, border, padding, margin and text color. 
- And in the end i added the javascript code to animate the page. 
I've set that the button once clicked will be hided and that the divs except the first will be shown with delay once clicked the button "Click me". 
Than i've set that the background image will be shown with delay once the button is clicked and the text in the divs will be changed with delay once the button is clicked and all the divs and background image are shown.
